A modified Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to solve the single-pair shortest path problem. A modified Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to solve the single-pair shortest path problem. 

Example (cont'd) 
i = order in which node handled 
x.d = length of shortest path from s = F to x 
= edge of current shortest path tree 
Shortest path from s = F to t = H using DIJKSTAPAIR.

Note: g(s,x) is the same as x.d in Dijkstra 
Example (contd) 
For graph shown, using the 
coordinates and above Euclidean 
distance:
